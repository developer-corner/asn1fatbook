# ASN.1 FAT Book
The book of **F**amous **A**SN.1 **T**ypes (**FAT**Book) does not only contain a lot of famous ASN.1 types but also ASN.1 values.

This is a generated PDF document with full PDF links that can be used as a reference to browse all kinds of ASN.1 types and values originating from various RFCs.

ASN.1 values come with full DER encodings as hexdumps. Especially the encodings of OBJECT IDENTIFIERs (OIDs) may be helpful.

The ASN.1 AlgorithmIdentifier declarations in this document along with their DER encodings may also help if you dump ASN.1 and want to check if the AlgorithmIdentifier (its parameters) match a specific pre-defined value.

Enjoy.
